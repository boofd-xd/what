   <p>12/18/2024: i quit man </p> <br>
   <p>the whole "omg!!!!!! i get to code and make websites" thing was awesome for a long while but eventually with how some people looked at what i liked doing as some nerd shit they can use as cannon fodder i was just perpetually never happy with how shit was when it came out the oven</p><br>
   <p>like man don't get me wrong i love this site but the second hand embarrassment sucks. it's code that's not mine, and the code that is mine is... <a href="https://boofd.site/placeholder/crack/crack.html">bad.</a> but i couldn't grow because when i did i was either getting infantilized or i was being told straight to my face that i wasn't impressing anyone to the point where anything i did seemed pretentious. </p> <br>
   <p>that shit broke my fucking heart, man. and i was and still am being percieved as this fat fuck sweaty nerd SOLELY because of the shit i enjoy and the fact i'm still bad at it to the point where fuck it, i'm shedding it off. i'm done. </p> <br>
   <p>still fucking love this site too, and i'm still gonna support it, but the ideas i've planned and shared (with lukewarm reactions) are gone.</p>

   <p>requests are staying open, but i'm tearing down some parts and leaving what's left to rot until i get some random second wind. not after another photoshop update though.</p> <br>
